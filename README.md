# AliAbasi
A Programming Language made from a school prank.
## Currently I'm maintaining this project.

### Compilation 
Run 'run' file.
It will both compile the compiler and run the compiler
It will also display help menu of compiler.
You can pass compiler option straightly to 'run' file like:
  ```
  ./run -s thisisprogram.aa
  ```
